          <h3>Information Design</h3>
          <p>
            Orb.Farm's pixel-art style conveys its features in a very
            minimalistic way. Environmental data (COâ‚‚ and oxygen levels) are
            displayed using the bar indicators that change in real time, so that
            the user is never overloaded with information. The simplicity of
            this web experience encourages exploration and understanding without
            making the users feel bored.

          <h3>Mapping</h3>
          <p>
            By clicking the item buttons on the menu, users can deploy the
            specific thing on the simulation bubble by simply clicking it. The
            side menu, which contains all of the buttons and other features, is
            mapped to be always in the same place. The features that are in this
            web experience are mapped in a consistent and organised way, which
            makes it easy for the user to understand. For example, buttons used
            for spawning items are characterised by colours, which helps the
            user's experience. The literal style of mapping helps users quickly
            build an understanding of how the experience functions.

          <h3>Characterisation</h3>
          <p>
            Organisms and elements in Orb.Farm have different behaviours and
            dependencies, for example, like Algae photosynthesise, fish eat
            smaller organisms, and bacteria decompose waste. These behaviours
            are not dramatised but follow ecological rules. While it's not the
            most engaging experience, its purpose is to show how the system will
            react to different scenarios following to the user's choices.
          </p>

        <div class="sub-section">
          <h3>Feedback</h3>
          <p>
            The feedback for this experience is slow, the different scenarios of
            the simulation take time, and the scenarios that take place are
            based on the user's earlier decisions. But the user could also speed
            up the process by pressing the speed up button to see it go faster.
            There are also no sounds or notifications for the things that are
            going to be simulated, only the visual aspect of the experience
            changes to signify the time going by. The slow feedback encourages
            the user to be more patient and learn how to optimise the ecosystem
            little by little, and the fast forward button helps the users
            visualise the simulation quicker.

          <h3>Information Design</h3>
          <p>
            The interface of this website is very minimalistic, there is only a
            grid-like with cubes and a flesh-like ragdoll. There are no
            instructions on how to operate this, so the users have to figure it
            out themselves by interacting with it. The users are meant to drag
            the ragdoll into the cube, which causes it to make a unique sound.
            The designers main intention seems to be to invite the users to
            create different sounds and see how the ragdoll will react to the
            cubes that it hits. This encourages the user to experiment with the
            experience rather than follow instructions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
          <h3>Mapping</h3>
          <p>
            The mapping is very expressive and creative, it gives the users
            space to freely roam and see the space from different angles. The
            grid-like cube is always in the same place, which acts as a sort of
            anchor for the user to come back to. The ragdoll could also be
            controlled by the mouse, which the user could throw/drag into the
            cube, which triggers different sounds. It also has a BPM slider to
            control how fast the notes from the cube go. This design helps the
            user to freely experiment without it being too complicated, and
            causes the user to create a sense of rhythm through the chaos by
            using the ragdoll.

        <div class="sub-section">
          <h3>Characterisation</h3>
          <p>
            The ragdoll, which is a lifeless, fleshy object, is a very abstract
            and stylistic character. Its responses to the actions that the user
            does are very exaggerated and unpredictable, which makes it the
            centre of the web experience. Its grotesque and disturbing sound
            draws out a strong reaction from the user, which draws them deeper
            into the experience.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
          <h3>Feedback</h3>
          <p>
            The feedback of the experience is immediate. The sound cube will
            react and play the specific note that the user chose and follow the
            set BPM. This is the same case for the ragdoll, which will react
            immediately when coming in contact with the sound cube. This creates
            a different sound each time depending on the location of the ragdoll
            and the notes set by the user. This also encourages the users to
            experiment with movement and timing. Every collision will produce a
            different sound, movement, and visual which rewards the users
            curiosity.
